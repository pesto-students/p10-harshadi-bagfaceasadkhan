Here the output will be 0.

This is because the message variable is set only once at the starting of the call when the value of the count variable is 0.
Althought the count varible gets incremented everytime the increment() fucnction is called but the message variable is not 
updated according to the count variable hence we get this output. 

To solve this we just need make sure the message variable gets updated with every call of the increment function.
